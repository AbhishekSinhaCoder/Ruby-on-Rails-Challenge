# Ruby-on-Rails-Challenge
Design a simple rails app that communicates with Google Drive API using the
google-drive-ruby gem ( https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby ).
The app should communicate with the Drive through a service account (see documentation
above for how a service account works). Use a client_secret.json file (provisioned when a
service account is created in https://console.developers.google.com/ ).
The interface of the app, once loaded in the browser should simply output the contents of the
drive the service account has access to. You can format these contents as you wish and
demonstrate your capabilities.
Version requirements:
- Ruby 2.5.1+
- Rails 6+
- Google Drive API V3
# First run yarn install then run rails server
